# GPT4ALL-Voice-Assistant
This is a 100% offline GPT4ALL Voice Assistant. Completely open source and privacy friendly. Use any language model on GPT4ALL. Background process voice detection. Watch the full YouTube tutorial for setup guide: https://youtu.be/6zAk0KHmiGw
## Setup
I highly advise watching the YouTube tutorial to use this code. You will need to modify the OpenAI whisper library to work offline and I walk through that in the video as well as setting up all the other dependencies to function properly. 
## Improvements to think about adding to yours
Give a system prompt. These open source models perform far better when you send a system prompt as specified in the GPT4ALL documentation: https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_python.html#introspection
